## Papers

### 🔹 Large Language Model Hallucination Mitigation
**Title:** Linear Regression Approach for Word Logits in Large Language Models  
**Summary:** My research focuses on mitigating hallucinations in large language models by applying **word logit linear regression** techniques.  
**Publication:** [ARR 2024 (Under Review)](https://arxiv.org/your-paper)  

### 🔹 Sparse Autoencoder for Feature Compression
Developing methods to **reduce feature costs** in Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) by computing **cosine similarity and KL divergence** across different layers.
